# Service Registry


## Roadmap

 [x] build server
 [x] build client

 [x] K8S for server
 [x] Create dashboard host app
 [x] K8s for dashboard app using server-registry


### Component One - just a noddy data source stub
 [ ] Create MFE Svelte web-component
 [ ] K8S for ^^^^ using server-registry client

### Other components
 [ ] an "OpenAPI", contract-first (cask?) app?
 [ ] a Apache Pinot source
 [ ] a WebSocket dashboard
 [ ] a GraphQL data source
 [ ] A Galaxies app :-)

 ...
 [ ] other frameworks for web-components (react, vue, nextjs, ...)

Nice-to-have
 [x] local argocd options
 [ ] CI/CD for publishing to docker from github (TODO - see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-docker-images))
     - for now we'll just do this locally
