# Demo

This is how to "boot up" this micro-architecture on a new K8S cluster, showing:
 * docker
 * kubectl
 * k9s
 * argocd

And an example of [micro-front-end](https://micro-frontends.org/)s on kubernetes.

The order of development/testing is typically:

1) locally: in your favorite IDE -- run individual components
2) locally: in its packaged environment (docker build, docker run)
3) locally: in its deployed (integration) environment (kubectl apply or local argoCD)

After that, it should/can be nearly 100% consistent when done remotely -- and the process looks the same

TL;DR: To just spin up everything:
```

pushd ~/code/argo-drone/argo
make install
make login

# install in argo
cd ~/code/mfe/service-registry/server && make installArgo
cd ~/code/mfe/dashboard && make installArgo
cd ~/code/mfe/components/pinot-example/web && pwd && make installArgo


# or install directly
k create namespace mfe
k apply -f ~/code/mfe/service-registry/server/k8s/*.yaml
k apply -f ~/code/mfe/dashboard/server/k8s/*.yaml
k apply -f ~/code/mfe/dashboard/web/k8s/*.yaml
k apply -f ~/code/mfe/components/pinot-example/web/k8s/*.yaml


# or tear it all down:
k delete namespace mfe & 
k delete namespace argocd &

popd
```

## server registry

### show in docker

```
cd service-registry/server

# start the server
make run

# show a bit of docker
# docker ps
# docker exec -it <SHA> bash
# whatevs


# show the endpoint (port-forward in k9s)
open http://localhost:8080/api/v1/registry/

# run some noddy tests (via curl) to get some data in there...
make test

#Â refresh browser, then kill it:
docker ps

./kill.sh
```

### ok - let's deploy in kube

1. show the k8s config

2. show kubectl

```
kubectl get all --all-namespaces
# or 
kubectl get all -n mfe
```

create our app in k8s:

```
cd service-registry/server/k8s 
k create namespace mfe
k apply -f server.yaml

k get all -n mfe 

k get service -w -n mfe 

```

### show k9s
```
k9s
```

logs, shell, port-forward ...

## show argo

argo is CD for K8S


let's install [argo-drone](https://github.com/easy-being-green/argo-drone) locally...

watch this in K9S:

```
cd ~/code/argo-drone/argo/
make install
make login

open http://localhost:9090
```

Now install our service-registry:

```
# back to our original directory
cd - 

# let's stop our service
k delete -f server.yaml

# and install it using CD
cd ../
make installArgo
```


### Full-whack, install everything
```
pushd ~/code/mfe/service-registry/server
make installArgo

cd ~/code/mfe/dashboard/server
make installArgo

cd ~/code/mfe/dashboard/web
make installArgo

cd ~/code/mfe/components/pinot-example/web
make installArgo

popd
```

## Show dashboard
At this point we should be able to port-forward our dashboard web app and show that locally.

Now - without touching anything (or our namespace), we should be able to:
1) create a new component 

```
sbt new aaronp/mfe-svelte.g8
# cd <app>, test it:
make run 
# ok, kill it and push a release
make push

# now add it into our cluster, either via argo...
make installArgo
# ...or directly...
make deploy
```

2) nice. We should now be able to refresh the dashboard and see our new app!

This goes for releases as well - we can update our component completely "hands-free"

3) ... and now delete it!
```
kubectl delete -f k8s
# or the whole (new) namespace
kubectl delete namespace <namespace>
```
we should see that it goes stale after 15 seconds in the dashboard (as the heartbeat stops)
